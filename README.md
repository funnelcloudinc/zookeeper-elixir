zookeeper-elixir
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vishnevskiy/zookeeper-elixir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vishnevskiy/zookeeper-elixir)

# Getting Started

To use Zookeeper with your projects, edit your mix.exs file and add it as a dependency:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:zookeeper, github: "vishnevskiy/zookeeper-elixir"}]
end
```

# Overview 

The goal of this project is to provide a Zookeeper client for Elixir that follows the philosophy [Kazoo](http://kazoo.readthedocs.org/) for Python. It implements a clean API and provides common receipes
around the Zookeeper API such as Locks, Election and more.

The implementation is currently wrapping [erlzk](https://github.com/huaban/erlzk) which is the best Erlang Zookeeper client I could find and exposes a clean API. It ensures everything is using strings instead of char lists and provides a couple recipes. 

There are some quirks from wrapping **erlzk** which I would like to eventually get rid of by implementing the actual Zookeeper communication in Elixir and wrapping the **erlzk** dependency. 

# Usage

The code is fairly documented and has tests and typespecs so just reading it should provide all the information needed to use the library effectively.


```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Zookeeper.Client.start
{:ok, path} = Zookeeper.Client.create(pid, "/testing", "some data")
{:ok, {data, stat}} = Zookeeper.Client.get(pid, path, self())
{:ok, stat} = Zookeeper.Client.set(pid, path, "some new data")
receive do
  {Zookeeper.Client, ^path, :data} -> IO.puts("data changed in #{path}")
end
```

# TODO

- Implement Election recipe
- Deal with session events and lost session scenarios
- Re-implement Zookeeper protocol and drop **erlzk** as a depenedency.
